# *    I would love to believe in a world where licensing shouldn't be
# *    necessary; where people would respect others' work and wishes, 
# *    and give credit where it's due. 
# *    A world where those who find people's work useful would at least 
# *    send positive vibes--if not an email.
# *    A world where we wouldn't have to think about the potential
# *    legal-loopholes that others may take advantage of.
# *
# *    Until that world exists:
# *
# *    This software and associated hardware design is free to use,
# *    modify, and even redistribute, etc. with only a few exceptions
# *    I've thought-up as-yet (this list may be appended-to, hopefully it
# *    doesn't have to be):
# * 
# *    1) Please do not change/remove this licensing info.
# *    2) Please do not change/remove others' credit/licensing/copyright 
# *         info, where noted. 
# *    3) If you find yourself profiting from my work, please send me a
# *         beer, a trinket, or cash is always handy as well.
# *         (Please be considerate. E.G. if you've reposted my work on a
# *          revenue-making (ad-based) website, please think of the
# *          years and years of hard work that went into this!)
# *    4) If you *intend* to profit from my work, you must get my
# *         permission, first. 
# *    5) No permission is given for my work to be used in Military, NSA,
# *         or other creepy-ass purposes. No exceptions. And if there's 
# *         any question in your mind as to whether your project qualifies
# *         under this category, you must get my explicit permission.
# *
# *    The open-sourced project this originated from is ~98% the work of
# *    the original author, except where otherwise noted.
# *    That includes the "commonCode" and makefiles.
# *    Thanks, of course, should be given to those who worked on the tools
# *    I've used: avr-dude, avr-gcc, gnu-make, vim, usb-tiny, and 
# *    I'm certain many others. 
# *    And, as well, to the countless coders who've taken time to post
# *    solutions to issues I couldn't solve, all over the internets.
# *
# *
# *    I'd love to hear of how this is being used, suggestions for
# *    improvements, etc!
