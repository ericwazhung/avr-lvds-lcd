//This attempts to prevent the REFRESH_ON_CHANGE issue where alternating
//rows seem to be not-displayed... (originally NOGO)...
//The idea was to continue running the dot-clock via PWM whenever the
//display isn't being refreshed.
//SO FAR: FB_REFRESH_ON_CHANGE TRUE, _COUNT=1:
// _DELAY=10ms is OK, but 100ms causes the lines to alternate and the
// screen to flicker...
//FB_REFRESH_ON_CHANGE FALSE displays perfectly, but causes there to be no
//CPU power for other processes (like updating the image)
//a/o v90: This has been used for some time, now...
//THIS IS DIFFERENT than LCDSTUFF_INCLUDE_NON_DE...
// Whereas, in this case, that indicates to lcdStuff to continue to
// bitbanging the pixel-clock even when there's no *visible* pixel-data
// (during V-blanks)
// THIS indicates to switch over to PWM-pixel-clocking when there is no
// data to be sent... (especially between refreshes)
// That could be considered an extended v-blank, but it's different in that
// this form of v-blank is somewhat unpredictable in duration
// lcdStuff's v-blank is highly precise to the specs supplied...
// In other words, this *continues* to send pixel-clocks even when
// lcdStuff's lcdUpdate() is disabled... and does-so by means of switching
// over the pixel-clock from bit-banging to PWM...
// I believe the importance lies in that this PWM mode is actually during 
// the V-Front-Porch (?) whereas LCDSTUFF_INCLUDE_NON_DE assures a specific
// number of pixel-clocks *during and after* the vsync, *immediately
// before* data is actually drawn.
// TODO? Since this seems to be a somewhat common thing to do, maybe it'd
// make sense to use *one* method (either bitbanging or pwm) and tell
// lcdUpdate() to run in "extended-VFP" mode...?
// OTOH, bitbanging eats up CPU time, and it's nice to be able to free that

// From: http://cas.et.tudelft.nl/~rene/acx705akm.html

// Haven't done the math, so I'm assuming the 82ohm resistor limits it to

// V_F_LED=6.75V         |__________________________|
// Then Vin needs to take into account the LM317's drop, as well as the two
// resistors... 
// In the circuit supplied from the above page, a MAX860 is used as a
// voltage-doubler from (what appears to be) 5V, so Vin is 10V in that
// case.
//
// From the LM317 datasheet:
// Iout = (Vref / R1) + Iadjust ~= 1.25V / R1 := 1.25 / 82 = 15.24mA
// So, Vin must be > 6.75 + 1.25V
// But, also, Vi-Vo is specified as >= 3.0V So... that'd require 11V?
// Dunno how the LM317 functions at low Vi-Vo values...


// I opted to use a Texas Instruments 3.0V 50mA LDO regulator in a similar
// configuration, since I have several in stock: TPS76030

//                         '--------+------------+------> 15mA out
//
// Because this is LDO, the input voltage requirement is nearly (?) the
// same as for the LM317, despite the large "adjust" voltage of 3V
// Maximum drop-out (between pins 1 and 5) is .18V
// (as opposed to most regulators' requiring nearly 2V)
// So the total Vin needs to be 3.18V greater than the LED forward-voltage
// (The LM317 datasheet I have doesn't list the minimum Vi-Vo but is
// specified for 3V drop-out!)
//
// The TPS76030 specifies that a >= 2.2uF tantalum capacitor is necessary
// for LDO regulators to ground. It doesn't specify usage as a
// current-regulator, so it's just a guess that it should work smoothly as
// shown. (It's lit, but hasn't been 'scoped).

// we're actually using bit-banging for the MCK pin, it seems to work fine,
// as long as the pixel-clock keeps running between refreshes... So, after

// These experiments seem to be having the expected effect, but I'm a bit
// lost as to how the shift could still be so great after only two H_LOW
// dots, and no HD_DOTS... still seems to be shifted about 10 pixels in
// DE_BLUE, which should, realistically, only be a handful of CPU
// instructions between Hsync_fromNada() + Hlow_Delay()...
// Nada_fromHsync() -> HD_Delay() (0 should optimize out, no?)
// -> if(dataEnable) -> drawPix(rowNum) (inlined)

// EXPERIMENTATION:
//
// Because this display relies on a specific number of pixel-clocks between
// Hsync and the beginning of data, the whole shebang of lcdStuff.c's BLUE
// tests are somewhat flakey...
//
// BLUE_DIAG_BAR shifts right quite a bit more than DE_BLUE, etc.
// Likely due to the number of calculations performed to determine where to
// draw the dots...
//
// Realistically, I suppose, the BLUE tests are a bit flakey in that
// regard, they rely heavily on the fact of most displays I've worked with
// having (and paying attention to) the DataEnable (DE) signal... so
// differences in timing between Hsync and the actual data being available
// to display doesn't matter in those cases. This case is *entirely
// different* in that regard. 
//
// BLUE_DIAG_BAR_SCROLL is an extreme example. Whereas the above
// timing-values (H_LOW_DOTS=2, HD_DOTS=0) caused a shift of merely 10ish
// pixels in DE_BLUE, BLUE_DIAG_BAR_SCROLL seems to be shifted nearly half
// a screen-width. WHOA.
//
// INTERESTING RESULT(?)
// The very tip of the diagonal can be seen wrapped to the left of the
// screen... THIS COULD BE USEFUL...
// It suggests there may be a workaround to the highly-sensitive (and hard
// to match?) timing between Hsync and data, by relying on wraparound...?
// Possibly the entire display could be drawn without using Hsync at
// all...? (e.g. by "drawing" off-screen until it wraps to the next
// line...?)
// 
// It could be that e.g. the frameBuffer would be entirely capable of
// syncing properly with a little fine-tuning. That may be the Next Step,
// for now.

// MORE:
// Switching Hsync to another pin, such that the hsync signal is not
// recieved (nor initialized) (PB0) causes no image
// Doing the same with Vsync causes a scrolling image, but still
// right-shifted by the same amount...
// (Trying to figure out whether Hsync is being paid attention to, as it
// shouldn't be more than 64 cycles, or 16 dot-clocks between H-Low and the
// data, right...? in FrameBuffer mode with drawPixSetup)
// So, yes, Hsync is paid-attention-to

//BIT-BANGED MCK:
//a/o a while back (this being v86)
// I've switched over to a bit-banged MCK pin... I guess that's in
// _interfaces/6bitParallel.c
// bit-banged MCK seems fine, and relieves the above timing problems
// dramatically.
