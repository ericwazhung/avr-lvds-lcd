as-of v91: 
So far I've implemented 5 functionally-different displays:
	* Samsung LTN121X1-L02
	  (*TWO* models, with different revisions of the LVDS-receiver chip)
		FPD-Link, 12.1in, 1024x768, DE-Only
	* Chi Mei N121X5-L03(?)
		FPD-Link, 12.1in, 1024x768, DE-Only
	* BOEhydis HT12X21-240
		FPD-Link, 12.1in, 1024x768, DE-Only
	* Sony ACX705AKM-7
		9-bit parallel, ~2in, 240x160
		(3bits per color; separate Hsync, Vsync, and pixel-clock signals)


So far, only *one* display has never worked with this system:
	* IDTech IAXG01
	  FPD-Link, 12.1in, 1024x768, NOT DE-Only
	  (This display has the following note in the data-sheet:
		"When there are invalid timing, Display appears black pattern.
		 Synchronous Signal Defects and enter Auto Refresh for LCD Module
		 protection Mode.")
	  (Actually, I believe there was a time I had *something* displayed on
		this screen, but it was LONG ago, and it never did sync up... It has
		since bit-the-bucket.)


IMPLEMENTING A NEW DISPLAY:
	see, e.g., samsungLTN121X1_v6651.h which has different DE_ACTIVE_DOTS
	for different modes... 
	Ideally, every drawing function would match *exactly* the 
	timing-parameters given in the selected _displays/ file, then things'd
	work regardless  of the drawing-function... but AS-YET that's not yet
	possible. Some drawing-functions take longer than others (especially in
	BLUE_TESTING)



SAMSUNG LTN121X1-L02:
	Two models have been implemented in this system, with the following
	receiver-chips:
		LXD91810 VS242AC
		LXD91810 VS252AG

	As I recall, the AC required a faster bit-rate to sync-up properly
	(notes exist elsewhere)
	Thus, (now) the *default* setting is the fastest bit-rate possible for
	this system (16MHz * 8PLL = 128Mbps, BUT the CPU frequency can be
			nearly-doubled via OSCCAL, so it's *nearly* 256Mbps(?!)

	
	This display is nice in that it seems highly tolerant of very strange
	timing-signals; huge horizontal-front-porches and 
	very slow refresh-rates...
	
	* Works Well With rowSegBuffer
	* Has *visible* refresh:
		* Flickers at medium refresh-rates (e.g. 10Hz)
		* Shows a visible scrolling-black line when refreshing at
		  extremely-low refresh-rates (e.g. 1/5Hz with rowSegBuffer)

	Apparently continues displaying dots at the end of DE (and/or repeats 
		those from the previous row?)
	 Nada + disableGreen -> green even though DE_ACTIVE_DOTS is too short.

	Has a tendancy to repeat previous row if (?)...
		Timing ain't right...?

CHI MEI N121X5:
	Has NO VISIBLE REFRESH (WOW!)

BOEHYDIS HT12X21:
	Visibility of refresh is *significantly* diminished compared to Samsung
	BLUE_DIAG_BAR_SCROLL (in 66.51-63!) is no visible refresh AT ALL

	Apparently stops displaying dots at the end of DE...
		(Nada + disableGreen -> green on the LTN, but Black here...)

SONY ACK705AKM-7:
	This display DOES NOT HAVE a Data-Enable input.
	Thus, it relies on a specific number of pixel-clocks from the edge of
	the Hsync until data is displayed at the first pixel.

	THUS: It has been found that the MCK (pixel-clock) input is tolerant of
	varying pulse-widths (edge-sensitive, not timing-sensitive) and so
	bit-banging of the pixel-clock has been implemented.
