THIS COMMIT IS OLD!
Currently, the version I last-developed (on my desktop) is v135
The version, here, is v98.
This version, v98, is the latest-version uploaded to the interwebs.

There've been some big-ol' changes inbetween. A list-of-which I haven't compiled...

The big one is that the configuration/file-layout has changed, somewhat dramatically...
  Allowing for easier configuration-switching
  Allowing for LVDS displays to run on the ATtiny85
  (Also addition of the 6-bit--2bits/color--parallel-LCD interface?)

Also, the option to use the display as a binary-clock.


For Now:
You'll have to contact me if you're interested in the newer features...
